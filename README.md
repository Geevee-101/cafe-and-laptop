# Cafe and Laptop
A site where registered users can find, share, and rate work-friendly cafes. Made with Python, Flask, SQLAlchemy, PostgreSQL, HTML, CSS, and Bootstrap.

You may visit the site here: https://cafe-and-laptop.onrender.com/

The site may take a while to load because it spins down with inactivity.
Also, note that I made this site for my portfolio. It is not an actively maintained site.

# Project Description
This site is for users who want to find a great cafe to work at.

A user does not need to register to browse the cafe list. But registered users gains privilege to add, edit, update, and delete a cafe from the database. The user can also leave reviews while giving it a thumbs up or down. The site will collate all the user ratings to display the overall rating of a cafe.

I wanted to build a website that showcases my backend skills in Python. As such, I decided to use Bootstrap to speed up the frontend work.
